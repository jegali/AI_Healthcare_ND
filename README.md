# AI_Healthcare_ND

This repository contains detailed notes and multiple projects implemented in Python for the "AI for Healthcare"-Nanodegree of Udacity.


## Course 1:  

2D imaging, such as X-ray, is widely used when making critical decisions about patient care and accessible by
most healthcare centers around the world. With the advent of deep learning for non-medical imaging data
over the past half decade, the world has quickly turned its attention to how AI could be specifically applied to
medical imaging to improve clinical decision-making and to optimize workflows. Learn the fundamental skills
needed to work with 2D medical imaging data and how to use AI to derive clinically-relevant insights from
data gathered via different types of 2D medical imaging such as x-ray, mammography, and digital pathology.
Extract 2D images from DICOM files and apply the appropriate tools to perform exploratory data analysis
on them. Build different AI models for different clinical scenarios that involve 2D images and learn how to
position AI tools for regulatory approval.

## Course 2:  

3D medical imaging exams such as CT and MRI serve as critical decision-making tools in the clinician’s
everyday diagnostic armamentarium. These modalities provide a detailed view of the patient’s anatomy and
potential diseases, and are a challenging though highly promising data type for AI applications. Learn the
fundamental skills needed to work with 3D medical imaging datasets and frame insights derived from the
data in a clinically relevant context. Understand how these images are acquired, stored in clinical archives, and
subsequently read and analyzed. Discover how clinicians use 3D medical images in practice and where AI holds
most potential in their work with these images. Design and apply machine learning algorithms to solve the
challenging problems in 3D medical imaging and how to integrate the algorithms into the clinical workflow.
