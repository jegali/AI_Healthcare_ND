# AI_Healthcare_ND

This repository contains detailed notes and multiple projects implemented in Python for the "AI for Healthcare"-Nanodegree of Udacity.

Course 1:  

2D imaging, such as X-ray, is widely used when making critical decisions about patient care and accessible by
most healthcare centers around the world. With the advent of deep learning for non-medical imaging data
over the past half decade, the world has quickly turned its attention to how AI could be specifically applied to
medical imaging to improve clinical decision-making and to optimize workflows. Learn the fundamental skills
needed to work with 2D medical imaging data and how to use AI to derive clinically-relevant insights from
data gathered via different types of 2D medical imaging such as x-ray, mammography, and digital pathology.
Extract 2D images from DICOM files and apply the appropriate tools to perform exploratory data analysis
on them. Build different AI models for different clinical scenarios that involve 2D images and learn how to
position AI tools for regulatory approval.
