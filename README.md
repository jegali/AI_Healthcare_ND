## Course 1: Applying AI to 2D Medical Imaging Data 

2D imaging, such as X-ray, is widely used when making critical decisions about patient care and accessible by
most healthcare centers around the world. With the advent of deep learning for non-medical imaging data
over the past half decade, the world has quickly turned its attention to how AI could be specifically applied to
medical imaging to improve clinical decision-making and to optimize workflows. Learn the fundamental skills
needed to work with 2D medical imaging data and how to use AI to derive clinically-relevant insights from
data gathered via different types of 2D medical imaging such as x-ray, mammography, and digital pathology.
Extract 2D images from DICOM files and apply the appropriate tools to perform exploratory data analysis
on them. Build different AI models for different clinical scenarios that involve 2D images and learn how to
position AI tools for regulatory approval.

## Course 2: Applying AI to 3D Medical Imaging Data 

3D medical imaging exams such as CT and MRI serve as critical decision-making tools in the clinician’s
everyday diagnostic armamentarium. These modalities provide a detailed view of the patient’s anatomy and
potential diseases, and are a challenging though highly promising data type for AI applications. Learn the
fundamental skills needed to work with 3D medical imaging datasets and frame insights derived from the
data in a clinically relevant context. Understand how these images are acquired, stored in clinical archives, and
subsequently read and analyzed. Discover how clinicians use 3D medical images in practice and where AI holds
most potential in their work with these images. Design and apply machine learning algorithms to solve the
challenging problems in 3D medical imaging and how to integrate the algorithms into the clinical workflow.

## Course 3: Applying AI to EHR Data 

With the transition to electronic health records (EHR) over the last decade, the amount of EHR data has increased
exponentially, providing an incredible opportunity to unlock this data with AI to benefit the healthcare system.
Learn the fundamental skills of working with EHR data in order to build and evaluate compliant, interpretable
machine learning models that account for bias and uncertainty using cutting-edge libraries and tools including
Tensorflow Probability, Aequitas, and Shapley. Understand the implications of key data privacy and security
standards in healthcare. Apply industry code sets (ICD10-CM, CPT, HCPCS, NDC), transform datasets at different
EHR data levels, and use Tensorflow to engineer features.

## Course 4: Applying AI to Wearable Device Data  

Wearable devices are an emerging source of physical health data. With continuous, unobtrusive monitoring
they hold the promise to add richness to a patient’s health information in remarkable ways. Understand the
functional mechanisms of three sensors (IMU, PPG, and ECG) that are common to most wearable devices
and the foundational signal processing knowledge critical for success in this domain. Attribute physiology
and environmental context’s effect on the sensor signal. Build algorithms that process the data collected by
multiple sensor streams from wearable devices to surface insights about the wearer’s health.
